# Overwatch_enemy_recognition

Overwatch enemy recognition is a small personal studying project where I'm trying to train yolo26-N base model on a dataset to detect the **enemy head**, **enemy body**, **enemy health bar** and **enemy character**.  
The dataset and training was made by me and isn't included in the github for fear of misuse and storage issues.  
If you want to reproduce it yourself (without ill intent), know that I was using an amd 7700xt GPU and amd 7700 CPU with 32Gb DDR5 ram for inference. And for training I was using a laptop with a rtx 3050 and 16Gb of ram. If you're using something else (especially a smaller gpu) you might need to adjust the code for the following. Also, try to keep the same resolution in game, in my case I chose low settings.

```

## Creating the environment (windows)
1. Create the virtual environment named 'ow2_env'  
```py -3.11 -m venv ow2_env```  
(if you don't have python python 3.11 you can get it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119))

3. Activate the environment
For PowerShell:  
```.\ow2_env\Scripts\Activate.ps1```  
For CMD:  
```.\ow2_env\Scripts\activate.bat```

4. Upgrade pip  
```python -m pip install --upgrade pip```

5. Install all libraries from the requirements file  
For AMD GPU users:  
```pip install -r requirements.txt```  
For NVIDIA GPU users:  
```pip install -r requirements_nvidia.txt```
